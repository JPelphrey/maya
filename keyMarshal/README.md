# ![icon]( https://github.com/mortentoo/Maya/raw/master/keyMarshal/icon/keyMarshal.png ) Key Marshal

### Description


Ensures all attributes are keyed if at least one attribute has a key. Will also set a key if another object in the selection has a key, unless the **Per Object** option is selected.

This is useful if you are animating a character and have randomly keyed various controllers and want to make sure everything is keyed synchronously - for example for retiming purposes.

### Instructions
1. Copy the script to the Maya script folder.
2. Execute keyMarshal() from the script editor or add the command to a shelf button or hotkey.
3. Use the supplied icon for the shelf button if you like :)
